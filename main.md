# Derpyzza's hypertext labyrinth

There's a specific type of personal webpage that's been gaining traction in several niche corners of the internet, commonly referred to as ["Digital Gardens", or "Personal Wikis", or "Hypertext Gardens" ](digital-gardens)
This is my version of such a webpage.
This is where i'll be dumping all of my 
- notes
- random essays and articles
- knowledge 
- random things i find interesting
All publically accessible for others to learn from.

As for the title "hypertext labyrinth", i chose that as a way to represent the fact that this will be inherently very chaotic and expansive, while using links as a sort of "hallway system" to connect two or more notes together. I wanted this thing to have a theme too, which is another reason for going with the term "labyrinth". I like the idea of visitors to this page ( That's You! ) playing the part of explorers exploring an underground labyrinth, uncovering it's secrets. As time passes on and this labyrinth grows, I'd like to add little bits of lore to notes and perhaps even some characters, to make it feel like a little rpg :)
