---

often times when working on a hobby project where you're attempting to (re-)create a custom version of something that already exists, you'll come across questions from other people that are always something along the lines of 

> "`$THING` already exists, why are you making another one?".

i have prepared a handy dandy list of rebuttals that can be used to counter their misplaced concerns.
simply tick all that apply and send it over to them ( Or stick it somewhere on your project's documentation or website if it has those ).

the list will be updated as i come up with more rebuttals.

here's the list:

# i'm making $THING because:

- [ ] it's fun
- [ ] i felt like it
- [ ] i bet i can sell this and get rich
- [ ] it'll probably look real nice on my resum√©
- [ ] people will think i'm a cool person for having made my own `$THING`
- [ ] ***i*** will think i'm a cool person for having made my own `$THING`
- [ ] there arent *enough* versions of `$THING` out there already and there needs to be more!
- [ ] it's trendy right now and i want to hop on the hype train myself
- [ ] i'm bored out of my mind and if i don't distract myself with this i'm going to lose my mind
- [ ] i happen to have the free will required to engage in this activity
- [ ] it's a good educational experience
- [ ] it fills some gap that i found in my knowledge/experience
- [ ] the other version(s) of `$THING` sucks because it's:
    - [ ] boring
    - [ ] poorly made
    - [ ] UNWORTHY!!!
    - [ ] bloated
    - [ ] messy
    - [ ] hard to use
    - [ ] difficult to understand
    - [ ] poorly documented
    - [ ] expensive
    - [ ] hard to acquire
    - [ ] slow to use
    - [ ] tedious to use
    - [ ] doesn't work very well
    - [ ] proprietary and i can't modify it
    - [ ] open and i *can* modify it, and i take issue with that for some reason D:<
- [ ] the other version(s) of `$THING` is fine but:
    - [ ] i wish it did x better
    - [ ] it's missing some features that could really enhance it / my usage of it 
    - [ ] difficult to aquire
    - [ ] unnecessarily bloated
    - [ ] poorly documented
    - [ ] expensive
    - [ ] tedious to use
    - [ ] doesn't fit enough of my use-cases for it to really be good for me
    - [ ] fails to offer x functionality
    - [ ] it's proprietary and i can't modify it
