      <p>ðŸ‘‹ Hello, i'm derpyzza</p>
      <p>
        I'm a programmer and an artist. I like experimenting with low level technologies,
        and enjoy making little games and drawings in my off time.
      </p>
      <p>This is my homepage, which acts as a blog, a link tree, as well as a portfolio of sorts</p>
      <p>Here are some links to get you started:</p>
      <ul>
        <li>
          <a href="/public/archive.html">blog posts</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://derpyzza.github.io">github</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://instagram.com/derpyzza">drawings</a>
        </li>
        <li>
          <a href="https://derpyzza.itch.io">games</a>
        </li>
      </ul>
      <br>
      <p>Also, here's a complimentary weird fish thing, on the house. It's not a very interesting fish thing, nor a very unique one. However, how many other websites have you come across with this specific fish
        on the first page? 
      </p>
      <p>checkmate.</p>
      <img src="assets/pixelartgamethingidk.png" alt="An image of a little pixel art fish-like creature standing atop a chiseled-stone looking platform. The platform has the fish standing on one edge, and a couple bits of seaweed growing on the other. You gaze upon this image and feel a sense of serenity wash over you. It feels good.">
