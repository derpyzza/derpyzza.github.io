        <h1>the free web textbook list</h1>
      </hgroup>
      <p>the following is a collection of free ***legal*** html/web-based textbooks on various subjects that i've
        encountered on the
        internet. free web based textbooks are really cool, and i think there really should be more of them on the
        internet. in the meantime though, im going to greedily store links to every single one i come across right on
        this page here >:D</p>

        <ul>
          <li>
            <a href="https://craftinginterpreters.com/">crafting interpreters - robert nystrom</a>
            <p>
              a really lovely book about writing interpreters for programming languages.
              i referenced this one a lot back when i was starting out with <a
                href="https://github.com/derpyzza/river/">river</a>
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://gameprogrammingpatterns.com/">game programming patterns - robert nystrom</a>
            <p>
              an interesting collection of handy programming patterns for game development. i still reference this one
              from time to time when making games :)
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://gamemath.com/">3D math primer for graphics and game development - fletcher dunn, ian
              parbery</a>
            <p>
              another great book that i reference occasionally, this time for game and graphic programming math
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://calculusmadeeasy.org/">calculus made easy - silvanus p. thompson</a>
            <p>
              i have yet to read anything past the first couple chapters of this one, but what little i read of it was
              very informative and really well written
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://cpu.land/"> putting the "you" in cpu - lexi mattick, hack club </a>
            <p> this one's not technically a textbook — it calls itself an article — but it's structured
              similarly to
              a textbook.
              and it's pretty informative, so it gets a place in this list
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://brianmcfee.net/dstbook-site/content/intro.html">digital signals theory - brian mcfee </a>
            <p>
              an introductory textbook for digital signals processing.
              honestly don't know very much about this one, i encountered it in a youtube video one time and i
              immediately bookmarked it. i'll get to it someday...
            </p>
          </li>
          <li>
            <a href="https://diveintosystems.org/"> dive into systems - Suzanne J. Matthews, Tia Newhall, Kevin C. Webb
            </a>
            <p>
              an introductory textbook for computing systems, computer organization, and parallel computing.
