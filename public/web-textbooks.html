        <h1>the free web textbook list</h1>
      </hgroup>
      <p>the following is a collection of free ***legal*** html/web-based textbooks on various subjects that i've
        encountered on the
        internet. free web based textbooks are really cool, and i think there really should be more of them on the
        internet. in the meantime though, im going to greedily store links to every single one i come across right on
        this page here >:D</p>

            </a>
            <p> this one's not technically a textbook — it calls itself an article — but it's structured
              similarly to
              a textbook.
              and it's pretty informative, so it gets a place in this list

              an introductory textbook for digital signals processing.
              honestly don't know very much about this one, i encountered it in a youtube video one time and i

              a neat book on writing fragment shaders. seems to be unfinished as of the time of writing this, but

              the chapters that are finished however, are really interesting nonetheless.
