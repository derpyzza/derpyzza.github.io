        <p>often times when working on a hobby project where you're attempting to (re-)create a custom version of something that already exists, you'll come across questions from other people that are always something along the lines of </p>
<blockquote>
<p>"<code>$THING</code> already exists, why are you making another one?".</p>
</blockquote>
<p>i have prepared a handy dandy list of rebuttals that can be used to counter their misplaced concerns.
simply tick all that apply and send it over to them ( Or stick it somewhere on your project's documentation or website if it has those ).</p>
<p>the list will be updated as i come up with more rebuttals.</p>
<p>here's the list:</p>

<li>[ ] it's a good educational experience</li>
<li>[ ] it fills some gap that i found in my knowledge/experience</li>
