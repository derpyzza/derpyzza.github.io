      <article>
      <p>often times when working on a hobby project where you're attempting to (re-)create a custom version of something that already exists, you'll come across questions from other people that are always something along the lines of "<code>$THING</code> already exists, why are you making another one?".
i have prepared a handy dandy list of rebuttals that can be used to counter their misplaced concerns.
simply tick all that apply and send it over to them ( Or stick it somewhere on your project's documentation or website if it has those ).</p>
<p>the list will be updated as i come up with more rebuttals.</p>
<p>here's the list:</p>
<h2 id="i'm-making-$thing-because:"><a href="#i'm-making-$thing-because:">#</a> I'm making $THING because:</h2>
<ul>
<li>[ ] it's fun</li>
<li>[ ] i felt like it</li>
<li>[ ] i bet i can sell this and get rich</li>
<li>[ ] making <code>$THING</code> will help me stroke my ego</li>
<li>[ ] it'll probably look real nice on my resumé</li>
<li>[ ] people will think i'm a cool person for having made my own <code>$THING</code></li>
<li>[ ] <em>i</em> will think i'm a cool person for having made my own <code>$THING</code></li>
<li>[ ] there arent <em>enough</em> versions of $THING out there already and there needs to be more!</li>
<li>[ ] it's trendy right now and i want to hop on the hype train myself</li>
<li>[ ] i'm bored out of my mind and if i don't distract myself with this i'm going to lose my mind</li>
<li>[ ] i happen to have the free will required to engage in this activity</li>
<li>[ ] it's a good educational experience</li>
<li>[ ] it fills some gap that i found in my knowledge/experience</li>
<li>[ ] the other version(s) of <code>$THING</code> sucks because it's:<ul>
<li>[ ] boring</li>
<li>[ ] poorly made</li>
<li>[ ] UNWORTHY!!!</li>
<li>[ ] bloated</li>
<li>[ ] messy</li>
<li>[ ] hard to use</li>
<li>[ ] difficult to understand</li>
<li>[ ] poorly documented</li>
<li>[ ] expensive</li>
<li>[ ] hard to acquire</li>
<li>[ ] slow to use</li>
<li>[ ] tedious to use</li>
<li>[ ] doesn't work very well</li>
<li>[ ] proprietary and i can't modify it</li>
<li>[ ] open and i <em>can</em> modify it, and i take issue with that for some reason D:&lt;</li>
</ul>
</li>
<li>[ ] the other version(s) of <code>$THING</code> is fine but:<ul>
<li>[ ] i wish it did x better</li>
<li>[ ] it's missing some features that could really enhance it / my usage of it </li>
<li>[ ] difficult to aquire</li>
<li>[ ] unnecessarily bloated</li>
<li>[ ] poorly documented</li>
<li>[ ] expensive</li>
<li>[ ] tedious to use</li>
<li>[ ] doesn't fit enough of my use-cases for it to really be good for me</li>

<li>[ ] it's proprietary and i can't modify it</li>
</ul>
</li>
</ul>
