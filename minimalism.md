# On Minimalism

I've been a huge fan of minimalism and the DIY mentality ever since i've started programming. The idea of building something from scratch that is small and lightweight rather than huge and bloated is an exciting one for me, and i love creating and finding things that are super minimalist while still being very user friendly and easy-to-use.
