# ~ Unnamed as of yet project

This is where i'll link things related to my unnamed as of yet project, where i aim to try and create a minimal suite of software ( and maybe even hardware like 40 years from now ) that is built to last for a decade or more.

## potential names
- winter
- ashra ( عشرہ, since the software is meant to last for a decade (or more) )
- dusk
- UAOY ( Unnamed as of yet, if i just get lazy and dont use any actual names )

## software to build
- Virtual Machine ( for fun, unnecessary )
- Operating System
- File Manager
- Window manager / Desktop environment
- Text editor
- Version control system like git
- Web browser
	-  No javascript
	-  Minimal
- C compiler
- Compiler for a C replacement language
	- Smart compiler like rust with hotswap / hot reload capabilities.
- Debugger for replacement language
- Assembler for virtual machine
- Scripting language
- Graphics library
- Software renderer
- Mini game engine

This is a list of neat little programs that reflects the feel and general vibe of the kind of software i'd like to build for this project.
